# Server Side Calculator

## Description

The Server Side Calculator Adds, Subtracts, Multiplies and Divides, two whole numbers entered on the DOM. The input from the DOM is stored on the server and returned as a list of completed equations. The list appends until the server is restarted. The = button returns the total. The "C" button clears the input. To facilitate the calculation of the input a switch and case statement was used, this was found in an example by Jennifer Bland on GitHub at ratracegrad/programming-a-calculator.
